ideas 

- theme: muscles in the human body 
- player starts with 5 lives and a score of 0
- each time they correctly guess a muscle, +1 to score
- each time they move to next guess, reset lives
- if lose all lives, GAME OVER!
- computer has list of muscles 
- computer randomly generates a muscle
- computer displays number of * corresponding to number of letters in muscle
- player presses a key to guess
- if correct, then asterisk -> letter
- if incorrect, display letter that was wrong, lose a life
- continue until lives are 0 or word is guessed
- if word is guessed then new word

pseudo-code

create array of muscles
math-random a muscle in array
generate * = length.muscle
prompt user press key
compare key to muscle string 
on key (from muscle string) display letter, add point to score
else if key already selected wait
else key incorrect remove life, add letter to incorrect guesses
repeat until guess complete
else lives lost 
generate new word
